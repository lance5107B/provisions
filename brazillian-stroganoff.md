# Ingredients

## Chicken
- 2 chicken breasts
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- salt & pepper to taste

## Sauce
- ½ can tomato sauce 24oz (600 g)
- 1½ cans table cream
- ½ tablespoon ketchup
- ½ tablespoon yellow mustard
- salt & pepper to taste

# Method of Preparation
1. Cut chicken breasts into ~ 1 inch chunks
2. Season chicken breasts with remaining chicken ingredients
3. Mix chicken chunks together, place in bag, vacuum and seal.
4. Add sauce ingredients to bag and mix thoroughly
   - **NOTE**: Check taste before sealing bag, may need more salt.
   - **NOTE**: Vacuum sealing may be tricky, the water submersion method is totally appropriate.
5. Mix the sauce some more once it's in the bag to make sure it's really well mixed
6. Sous vide chicken _and_ sauce in the same bath at 160°F (71.1°C) for 90 minutes
7. Prepare some starchy side dish -- white rice, shoestring potatoes, buttered egg noodles, etc.
8. Once chicken and sauce are done, open and mix together in a bowl
